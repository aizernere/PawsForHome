# üêæ Paws For Home 
## üåü **Description**
Paws For Home is an innovative pet adoption platform that connects animal shelters and potential adopters in a seamless and user-friendly environment. Users can choose to create an Adopter Account or a Shelter Account.

For Shelters: Shelters can list pets available for adoption, providing detailed profiles with essential information such as pet type, breed,and  age. Shelters can also manage adoption applications, review requests, and decide whether to accept or decline an adopter‚Äôs application based on their criteria.

For Adopters: Adopters can browse available pets, search using filters like pet type, age, and location, and submit adoption applications. Each application allows adopters to share details about their home environment, experience with pets, and other relevant information. Shelters review these applications, and the adopters are notified about the status of their request.

Paws For Home aims to facilitate a smooth adoption process, ensuring that both shelters and adopters have an easy and transparent experience throughout the journey.
